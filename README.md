# Week 14 - University of Adelaide Coding Boot Camp

## Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog

<br/>

## Description

This app is my first full-stack project. It's a website where you can publish your blogs and also read and comment on other user's blogs.
The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as a template engine, Sequelize as the ORM, and express-session for authentication.

## Usage

You can clone the repo and install the following packages

- bcrypt
- connect-session-sequelize
- dotenv
- express
- express-handlebars
- express-session
- mysql2
- path
- sequelize

Or you can use the deployed app via [Heroku](https://tech-blog-carlsantiago.herokuapp.com/)
